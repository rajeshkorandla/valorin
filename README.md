## Admin Panel Access

### Setting Up Admin Users
To access the admin panel, you must create an admin user with the proper admin role in your Supabase project. **Admin access is granted ONLY to users with `"role": "admin"` in their metadata.**

#### Method 1: Using Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to Authentication → Users
3. Click "Add User" and create an account with your desired email and password
4. After creating the user, click on the user in the list to edit
5. Scroll to the "User Metadata" or "App Metadata" section
6. Add the admin role to the metadata JSON:
   ```json
   {
     "role": "admin"
   }
   ```
7. Save the changes

#### Method 2: Using Supabase SQL Editor
Run this SQL query in your Supabase SQL Editor to grant admin role to an existing user:
```sql
UPDATE auth.users 
SET raw_app_meta_data = raw_app_meta_data || '{"role": "admin"}'::jsonb
WHERE email = 'your-admin@example.com';
```

**Important**: Replace `'your-admin@example.com'` with the actual email address of the user you want to make an admin.

### Accessing the Admin Panel
1. From the home screen, scroll to the bottom and click "🔐 Admin Login"
2. Enter your admin email and password
3. Once logged in, you'll have access to:
   - **Dashboard**: View submission statistics
   - **Manage Submissions**: View, search, and delete client and quote submissions

**Security Note**: 
- Only users with `"role": "admin"` in their user_metadata or app_metadata can access admin endpoints
- Regular users cannot access the admin panel even if they create an account
- Admin role must be explicitly set via Supabase Dashboard or SQL - there are no shortcuts or bypasses
- For maximum security, disable public signups in Supabase (Authentication → Settings → Auth Providers → Disable "Enable Email Signup")
